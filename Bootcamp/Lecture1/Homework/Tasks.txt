0. Go through examples, play with code

1. Create variable and initialize it with any value. Write into console variable name and it's value using nameof operator and interpolation.

2. Read three numbers from console and print their multiplication.
Sample Input:
9
7
8
Expected Output:
504

3. Swap first and last characters of a given string. Write result to console.
Sample Input:
"program"
Expected Output:
"mrograp"

4. Read two integers from console. Calculate their sum. If values were equal print triple of their sum, otherwise print sum dividev by 8.
Sample Input:
4
16
Expected Output:
2.5

5. Find largest and lowest value from three integers.
Sample Input:
43
-492
842
Expected Output:
Largest value = 842
Lowest value = -492

6. Read string from console. Create new string where first 5 characters will be in upper case. If string is less then 5 characters do nothing. Print it.
Sample Input:
"c# fundamentals"
Expected Output:
"C# FUndamentals"

7. Check if given integer is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7.
Sample Input:
14
Expected Output:
true

8. Check if given string starts from 'C#'.
Sample Input:
".NET Fundamentals"
Expected Output:
false

9. Read circle radius from console. Calculate it's perimeter and area.

10. In a loop read 10 numbers from keyboard. Find their sum and average.

11. Write a program to display multiplication table from 1 to n.
Sample Input:
3
Expected Output:
1x1=1 1x2=2 1x3=3
2x1=2 2x2=4 2x3=6
3x1=3 3x2=6 3x3=9

12. Read two integers. Print all numbers in range between first and second number that are divisible by 8. If range is invalid print error message.
Sample Input:
16
40
Expected Output:
3

13. Create enum type for TV channels (5 is enough). Write a switch statement that provides channel avarage rating.
